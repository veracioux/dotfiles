This directory contains the code and scripts that must be separate from the
literate configs, because they are needed to tangle the literate configs in the
first place.

The =Dockerfile= defines an image that can be run to generate all the configs as a
tar.gz archive.

#+begin_src shell
  docker run docker.veracioux.me/dotfiles-generator -u <USER>
#+end_src

Run with =--help= to see detailed usage.

* Potential improvements
- When I move all versioned dotfiles into =~/.haris=, I can remove the need to
  clone the repo inside the docker container.
