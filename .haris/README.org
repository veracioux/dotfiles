#+TITLE: My configs

The bootstrap directory contains everything that is needed to tangle all my
org-mode configs into actual usable config files.

* Installing dependencies
Most of my org-mode dotfiles have a *Setup* and/or *Dependencies* section with bash
scripts that will install all the dependencies for the configs defined in the
file.

TODO: The scripts should not be run directly, but instead using a frontend script that I
will create in the future.
* TODO Common keybindings
