# General guidelines
- Do not modify any files outside of this repository
- For any change I request, there is likely already a literate-programming
  .org file where the change best fits. Put the change in the best such file if
  possible, otherwise request clarification before making any changes.
- If there is a schema URL related to the code you are about to modify, respect it
- When you want to tangle a file after a change, offer to run the `tangle
  <file>` command. After tangling, you don't have to verify the content of the
  file, the output of the tangle command should suffice.
